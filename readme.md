# astro battles

A silly little game I wrote to show my girls how to write sprite-based
games in python, using pygame and with a little (very simple) vector
maths for Newton's law of gravity

## To play

Just run `python space.py`

## To install

Based on python `2.7`

Just relies on a few simple `pip installs`

- `pygame`
- `numpy`
